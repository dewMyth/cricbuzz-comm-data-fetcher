Litton notched up his fifty following that and Shamim gave the finishing touches. Saifuddin's cameo ensured they got over the 175-run mark.

The visitors lost the toss and their openers early today, but Litton Das played a captain's knock to steady the ship for them. Litton had a couple of crucial partnerships, first with Hridoy and later with Shamim. As a result of the contributions by these three batters, Bangladesh managed to post a challenging total at the end of 20 overs. In reply, Kusal Mendis was run-out by Shamim in the 2nd over itself and SL were put on the back foot early in the run chase. The hosts kept losing wickets at regular intervals following that and never looked comfortable in the run chase. Shoriful and Saifuddin took a couple of wickets, while Rishad Hossain was the pick of the bowlers as the leg-spinner claimed three wickets. SL eventually fell short by a massive margin of 83 runs and with the series levelled, the decider in Colombo should prove to be an interesting contest. Stay around for the presentations..",
