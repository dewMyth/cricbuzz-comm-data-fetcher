Bangladesh had a really productive powerplay as they scored 54 runs for the loss of one wicket. Just when things were going smoothly for the visitors, Sri Lanka struck back with a couple of wickets in quick succession. Litton Das was trapped lbw by Vandersay, while Theekshana removed the set batsman - Emon soonafter. Shanaka was introduced into the attack in the middle overs and he didn't allow the Bangladesh batters to rotate the strike and stemmed the flow of runs. Naim and Miraz chipped in with a much-needed partnership for the the 5th wicket and the cameo by Shamim Hossain helped Bangladesh breach the 150-run mark. The Sri Lankan bowlers bowled some good slower deliveries in the second half and as a result of that they were able to restrict the opposition batters.
